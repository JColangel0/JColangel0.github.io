            <h1>The Platinum Age Of Comics</h1>
            <h3>How The Funny Pages Caused An Alien Invasion</h3>

            <p>
                The Platinum Age of Comics is a time period ranging from 1897 to 1938. These dates are not arbitrary; the Platinum Age was bookended by 
                two very significant events that defined its beginning and ending. Although this period is roughly 41 years, the first product recognizable 
                as a modern comic book appeared in 1933, only five years before the end of the Platinum Age. Those five years kept the fledgeling industry 
                very busy: they were home to hundreds of publishers, writers, and artists who found themselves working in comic books. Before the explosion 
                of 1933 were decades of slow build up and natural evolution that set the stage for comic books to come on the scene. It all began with 
                a cheerful, colorful little cherub that appeared in a comic on the pages of Truth Magazine on June 2, 1894.

                That date coincided with the first appearance of the character that would become the famous Yellow Kid. The magazine ran a single panel 
                comic entitled <i>Feudal Pride in Hogan's Alley</i> that showcased a collection of children with dialogue written in the margins. These
                children were known as the Hogan's Alley Kids. Three more Hogan's Alley comics appeared over 1984 and early 1985. One of the comics, 
                <i>Fourth Ward Brownies</i> came to the attention of the <i>New York World</i>. The <i>World</i> was owned by Joseph Pulitzer, who was 
                attempting to create a populist newspaper in the days when the ability to read could not be taken for granted. In order to increase his 
                appeal to people who could not read, or at least could not read English, Pulitzer decided to adopt the 
                <a href="ComicStrips.htm">comic strip</a>. He purchased a top-of-the-line full color printing press and added a color comic section to 
                his Sunday paper. Now in the market for material, Pulitzer hired artists to create comics that were satirical, topical, or provided some 
                form of humorous commentary. Richard Felton Outcault, the man who had drawn the early Hogan's Alley cartoons, was a technical illustrator 
                formerly on staff at the <i>New York World</i>, and so Pulitzer put his comic strip to series in his new comic section. This proved to be a 
                profitable decision. The comic strip proved to be an instant hit. While it was technically entitled <i>Hogan's Alley</i>, the strip was almost 
                exclusively referred to as <i>The Yellow Kid</i>, so named for it's lead character.

                The Yellow Kid was named Mickey Dougan, a name used only by Outcault. He was a little boy, completely bald, and dressed in a yellow nightshirt.
                Him and the rest of the Hogan's Alley Kids were caricatures of poor immigrants depicted via classical racial stereotypes. The kids were rowdy, 
                often dirty, juvenile, and fiercly anti-authority, be it parents or the local dogcatchers. They proved a massive success: popular with the 
                working-class that consumed the <i>New York World</i> for their dirty humor and low intellectual demand; it took very little effort to read 
                and understand a comic strip. Their turf, the streets, alleys, and gutters of the Lower East Side, was home to a large portion of the 
                readers, who were often poor immigrants themselves. The massive success of The Yellow Kid quickly led to imitation, such as 
                <i>Happy Hooligan</i> or <i>The Katzenjammer Kids</i>, other early comic strips that were essentially The Yellow Kid in different trappings. 
                The competition grew fiercer when William Randolph Hearst purchased the <i>New York Journal</i> and his own color press. Outcault, and many 
                others, jumped from Pulitzer's camp to Hearst's, and The Yellow Kid followed. Pulitzer then hired another artist, George Luks, to continue 
                drawing the <i>New York World's</i> Yellow Kid feature, which devolved into a complex and expensive legal battle.
