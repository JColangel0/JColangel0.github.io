            <h1>How Comic Strips Influenced Comics</h1>
            <h3>The Use of Symbolism and Imagery Before Superheroes</h3>

            <p>
                The history of comic strips or, more broadly, comics as an artform, is broad and complex and goes back to ancient cultures and cave painting. 
                In the late 20th century comic strips were not a defining aspect of American culture, but they were certain not unfamiliar. Even the political 
                cartoons and graphic statements of Revolutionary and pre-Revolutionary America were antecedents of the satirical images popularized in the 
                late 1800s (think "Don't Tread On Me").
